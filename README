ABCNuke

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A set of plugins to read Alembic data in Nuke.

  - ABCReadGeo    (read geometry from an Alembic archive)
  - ABCAxis*      (read locators/transform data from an Alembic archive)
  - ABCCamera*    (read cameras from an Alembic archive)


The code for ABCNuke is freely available at http://github.com/ivanbusquets/ABCNuke/ , 
and released under the New BSD License. See COPYING for more details.

- NukeÂ® is a registered trademark of The Foundry.
- Alembic is an open interchange framework by
  Sony Pictures Imageworks and Industrial Light & Magic

*Note: At this time, only the source for ABCReadGeo is released. I need to
       clean up both ABCAxis and ABCCamera a bit, but hopefully they will
       follow soon.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Linux or MacOs operating system. I haven't been able to test this for
  Windows, but if anyone has success compiling and using any of the ABCNuke
  plugins on Windows, please let me know and I'll update this document.

- ABCNuke needs the following software / libraries

Nuke (6.2, 6.3)      - www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/
Alembic (1.0.x)      - www.code.google.com/p/alembic/
CMake (2.8.0)        - www.cmake.org
OpenEXR (1.6.1)      - www.openexr.com

Required by Alembic:
Boost (1.44)         - www.boost.org
HDF5 (1.8.7)         - www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download ABCNuke (.zip or .tar.gz) and extract the contents into your
   directory of choice (SOURCE_DIR)

2) Create a build directory, for an out-of-source build. This example assumes
   the build directory (BUILD_DIR) is located parallel to the SOURCE_DIR.
   But this is not required.

  $ cd SOURCE_DIR
  $ mkdir BUILD_DIR

3) Change to the build directory.

  $ cd BUILD_DIR

4) Now run cmake on the SOURCE_DIR.
   In order for cmake to find the path to the Nuke version you want to compile
   the plugins for, you'll need to pass a NUKE_DIR variable to the cmake command.
   
   Example: (assuming you're currently in BUILD_DIR, and SOURCE_DIR is one directory above)

  $ cmake -D NUKE_DIR=/usr/local/Nuke6.3v4 ..

   Alternatively, you can also set a NUKE_NDK_DIR environment variable before
   running cmake.

   Example:

  $ setenv NUKE_NDK_DIR /usr/local/Nuke6.3v4
  $ cmake ..

   If the cmake script can't find the Alembic libraries, you can also pass the Alembic
   root directory explicitly:

  $ cmake -D NUKE_DIR=/usr/local/Nuke6.3v4 -D ALEMBIC_DIR=/usr/local/alembic-1.0.3 ..

5) Run the make command. There's not a lot to compile, so it should go pretty fast :)

  $ make

6) Once done, you can run:

  $ make install

  Which will put a copy of the compiled plugin(s) in BUILD_DIR/plugins/x.x/ ,
  where x.x is the API-compatible version of Nuke (i.e. 6.3).

7) Copy the compiled plugin to the relevant location within NUKE_PATH
